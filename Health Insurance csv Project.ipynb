    "This program will use Python 3 to analyze data about medical insurance costs contained in a csv file. The file can be obtained at https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance. Its content contains data on:\n",
    "+ age: age of primary beneficiary\n",
    "+ sex: either female or male\n",
    "+ bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "+ children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents\n",
    "+ smoker: Smoking or not\n",
    "+ region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US sorted by northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\n",
    "+ charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance\n",

    "The goals of this project are to:\n",

    "+ Read data from a csv file.\n",
    "+ Organize the data into dictionaries. One dictonary will hold all of the data, and four more will hold data for each region.\n",
    "+ Create a class with methods for analyzing the data in each of those regions.\n",
